    <div class="flex-container"> <div class="flex-box"><pre style="font-size:25px;"><i>HELLO EVERYONE!</i>
        
        I am Khushboo Malik.I am currently pursuing my B.Tech            <img src="myself.jpeg" height="350" style="float:right;">     
        from CSE(AI-ML) branch from Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering
        College. I am fascinated by the world of web-development
        and designing,and hence have explored concepts such as 
        HTML,CSS and JavaScript.I utilize whatever available time 
        I have to explore more about evolving technologies.I have          
        also been honing my programming skills and am familiar 
        with C and C++.My hobbies are reading novels and listening
        to music.

<pre style="background-color:violet;padding:30px;"></pre>
<p style="background-color:slateblue;font-size:25px;font-family:courier;"><b>HTML/CSS:</b>
HTML and CSS are used to create the primary content of a webpage.They are supported by every single browser and are established on pretty much every webpage in existence.I have been exploring the 
world of HTML/CSS since 
about a month and have
been fascinated by the 
wonders we can create
through it.I have also 
made some basic projects
using HTML and CSS.</p>
<p style="background-color:violet;padding:20px;">
</p>

<p style="background-color:slateblue;font-size:25px;font-family:courier;"><b>Git/GitHub:</b>
Git is the most widely used 
modern version control system
in the world today.A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.I have been
using Git and GitHub to
create my own repositories
and collaborate on group 
projects with my friends and groupmates.I find it to be extremely useful and well-designed with a lot of avalaible features
through which we can easily share our own code and
also learn more about other's projects.    
</p>
<p style="background-color:violet;padding:20px;">
</p>
<p style="background-color:slateblue;font-size:25px;font-family:courier;"><b>C/C++:</b>
    C is considered as a foundation language for many languages.It is a versatile language, so it remains in high demand amongst professionals, such as software developers, game developers, C++ analysts and backend developers, etc.
    The career or job opportunities for C++ programmers are enormous because C++ is an old language, and a lot of code is already written in this language.
    I have been coding in C since the beginning of the academic year
    and have solved a variety of problems based on several
    concepts such as loops, functions, recursion, etc.
    I have also developed a strong foundation in C++ by 
    self-practising and learning from my mistakes.
